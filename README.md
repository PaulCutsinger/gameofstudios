I made a "Day-Cycle" branch to do some feature work. I've edited it's readme to describe that feature.

our git procedures. 
There are a lot of ideas about how to use git out there. EX: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ Let's figure out our own. The list below is the latest set of procedures. As we find better ways, we'll update this list.

- Create a branch for new features.
- Push from local to your branch.
- When the feature is ready and working, submit a pull request. That will prompt a code review and integration into master.
- (At some point we can add production, integration and test branches if needed - I think we're small enough to use master as integration)
